	File I/O moved from testing phase (always 1 file) to storing results in res folder
		File I/O functions in ptestio.c
	
	Primality test from RWG 7.5 implemented
		find_QPP_7_5 implemented (RWG7.c)
			P1, P2, and Q found with a lookup table, will fail ~1/10^22 times (can be fixed)
		find_QPP renamed to find_QPP_7_2_4
		get_ST_0 implemented (used in primality_test_7_5)
		get_next_ST_i implemented (used in primality_test_7_5)
		
	Substantial refactoring of code in RWG2.c, RWG2s.c, RWG7.c and RWG7s.c (primality tests)
		Significant speedup for test 7.2/4 in RWG by eliminating repeated computation
	
	Bugfixes to do with small primes (first million primes as found in primesSmall.txt) not being recognised as prime
	
	Many functions refactored slightly to be more readable, faster or more stylistically consistant
	
	All methods now have asymptotic time data in their description
	
	Added ChangeLog
	
	Some testing done and results in res folder (with Ar^n+/-1 for A <= 26, r <= 13, n <= 5000)
	






Future Updates
	main program split into testing for SIDH primes and OEIS primes (currently set up for OEIS)
